HashTable
=========

A Hashtable written in Python using Java's hashing algorithm. This was an in depth exploration of how a hashtable works. To run a test see ```Table_Test.py``` or import the function, make an instance and use the ```add_to_table``` and ```get_value``` functions...

```
from HashTable import HashTable
h = HashTable() 

print h.add_to_table(key, value)
print h.get_value(key)
```
